# Architecture - Roundwood

## Door assembly

An assembly is four ordinary `DoorBlock` states of one block, 2 wide x 2 high x 1 deep, showing one
round leaf. Each part has the vanilla `facing`, `half`, `hinge`, `open`, `powered` plus `column`
(left/right). **Identity** is `column` + `half`; **`hinge`** is the physical side the single leaf
turns on and is the same in all four parts.

**Anchor resolution** (`DoorLayout.of`): from any part, go down if `half=upper`, then one block
towards the counter-clockwise side of `facing` if `column=right`. That cell is the anchor
(lower-left). A part's partners are only the cells this rule names, and only if they hold the same
block with the same facing, hinge, column and half, so two assemblies side by side never merge.

**Hinge choice** (`DoorHingePlacement`): vanilla `DoorBlock.getHinge`, measured at the two cells
just outside the footprint (left of the anchor, right of the right column) and the cells above them:
a same-block door outside one edge puts the hinge on the other; otherwise the side with more full
blocks gets it; on a tie, the half of the clicked cell the player aimed at. The clicked cell is
always the lower-left part.

**Invariants**

- All present parts share `hinge`, `open` and `powered`.
- Every write Roundwood makes goes through `DoorPlacement`, `DoorStateController` or `DoorRemoval`,
  inside a `DoorMutationBatch` naming the four cells.
- Nothing reads an unloaded cell. State changes and redstone do nothing while any cell is unloaded
  (deferred, not treated as air); removal only clears loaded partners.

## Mutation publication

| Operation | Write flags | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Place | `UPDATE_ALL`, all four inside one batch | Forge's snapshot capture defers notifications until all four exist, and rolls all four back if the multi-place event is cancelled |
| Open / power | clients + immediate + known-shape | every part is written explicitly; no shape cascade and no neighbour updates (as vanilla door toggles) |
| Teardown | clients + known-shape + suppress-drops, then neighbour and shape updates per cleared cell | partners vanish silently before anyone else is told |

The batch suppresses Roundwood's own `onRemove`, `onPlace` reconciliation and neighbour reactions
for the marked cells. Nesting is capped at 4 and logged if exceeded.

**External writes.** `onPlace` sees every in-place state change on the server, whatever the flags
(even `UPDATE_CLIENTS` alone). If something else wrote a new `open` into one part without changing
its membership (Double Doors, commands), `DoorStateController.reconcileExternalOpen` writes the same
value to the partners, silently: the writer owns the sound. Our own batches and snapshot rollback
are ignored.

**Integrity.** A part appearing from anything but an in-place change (structure templates,
commands, our own placement) schedules a block tick (`DoorIntegrity`, 1 tick later, after the
writer finished). If all four cells are loaded and the assembly is incomplete, the part is broken
with its own loot and `DoorRemoval` clears its matching partners: at most one item. Missing parts
are never created; an unloaded cell re-schedules the check (every 20 ticks) without being read.
Vertically, `updateShape` keeps a part only while the cell above/below is its own column's other
half. Mirroring cycles `hinge` (vanilla) and `column`; rotation turns `facing` only.

## Loot ownership

Every part's loot table is `dropSelf` with the explosion condition. Exactly one item drops because
of ordering, not counting: the removal that started it (player break, explosion, support loss via
`updateShape`, integrity cleanup) evaluates its own loot; `onRemove` of that part clears the
partners with drops suppressed before vanilla notifies neighbours, so no partner is ever evaluated.
Creative breaks, replacement, fire and `doTileDrops=false` therefore drop nothing. Pistons are
refused (`PushReaction.BLOCK`). A cancelled placement being rolled back (`restoringBlockSnapshots`)
is not treated as a removal.

## Opening and redstone

- Click: the server toggles; the client returns success without predicting, and the server plays
  one sound for everyone.
- `setOpen` (villagers, MineColonies, other mods): explicit and idempotent.
- Redstone: powered = any of the four cells has a neighbour signal. Only a change of that value
  opens or closes; in between, players keep manual control.

## The leaf: geometry, collision, rendering

`door/leaf/DoorGeometry` describes one closed 32-pixel disc (2-pixel trim ring, recessed panel,
brass straps on the hinge side, one handle per face on the free side) in a 32x32 plane at depth
z 13..16, authored facing north. It turns as a rigid body about the vertical axis through the middle
of its hinge-side thickness (x 1.5 or 30.5, z 14.5), +90 / -90 degrees, so the open leaf lies along
the hinge wall (3/16 thick) and its outer half projects one block in the `facing` direction.

- **Collision / outline** (`DoorShapes`): the disc slab turned first, then clipped to each of the
  four cells and turned for `facing`; cached (64 variants). Open: the free column is empty, the
  hinge column keeps the inner half (29/16 clear width). The projection is visual only.
- **Rendering**: every door state uses an empty world model (break particle only). The anchor carries
  a non-ticking `RoundDoorBlockEntity`; `client/door/RoundDoorRenderer` draws the finish's baked
  leaf model (`block/<finish>_round_door_leaf_<hinge>`, registered for baking by `RoundwoodClient`,
  looked up per frame so resource reloads are safe) through the normal baked-model path
  (`Sheets.solidBlockSheet`, packed light of the anchor, overlay). It draws nothing for an
  incomplete assembly. `getRenderBoundingBox` covers the four cells plus the projection cells;
  `shouldRenderOffScreen` keeps it out of section culling.
- **Swing animation** (client only): `DoorSwing` holds a progress 0..1. `RoundDoorBlockEntity
  .setBlockState` (called by the chunk on every state change) retargets it when `open` flips, at
  the level's game time; the renderer samples it at game time + partial tick. 8 ticks for a full
  swing, sine ease-in-out; a reversal starts from the current progress over the proportional time.
  A new entity (placement, chunk load, relog) starts at rest. The server never animates: `open` and
  collision switch at once.

Models and collision come from the same boxes. The window is authored for `axis=x`: a full-depth
wooden housing filling every pixel outside a centred 12-pixel circle, glass at mid-depth inside it;
`axis=z` turns the model 90 degrees. Collision and outline are the full block.

## Data

Everything except the five textures is generated. `GeometryModelWriter` cuts every element at the
16-pixel texture-tile boundaries and writes vanilla's default UVs for its position inside its own
tile (Forge omits a UV equal to the default), so no face samples outside its sprite. Door: two leaf
templates (hinge left/right) plus per-finish bindings, one empty world model per finish and a
blockstate with a single `""` variant. Window: one template, per-finish bindings, `axis` variants.
Items (`RoundwoodItemModelProvider`): door items inherit the left-hinge leaf, window items the
window template, each with front GUI light and computed centred display transforms. Plus recipes
and their advancements, loot, tags and English names.
